Simple Buffer Manager similar to Mini Buffer Explorer and others. The
interface and code is kept as simple as possible. Several ideas are borrowed
from Mini Buffer Explorer but all code is original.

GitHub Home: https://github.com/LStinson/TagmaBufMgr

Features:

Smaller code base and as little code run on updates as possible. For example
the modification check that is performed after the |CursorHold| interval tries
to bail out as fast as possible if there is no change to the modification
state.

As much information as possible is cached for each buffer. This allows some
updates to perform very few actions. Unfortunately there are rare cases where
this causes stale data to display in the Buffer Window. Using the Manager
Refresh or switching to the Manager Window clears this data.

Addition to the Right-Click PopUp menu. Menu items are added to toggle the
Manager Window, Refresh the Manager Window and switch to each buffer.

Tool tips for the buffers listed in the Manager Window.
The Tool Tips display the following lines:
	* Buffer name and number. Also flags the current buffer.
	* Full file name, truncated with &#039~&#039 for home where possible.
	* The file type and format.
	* Notes if the buffer is Modified or Readonly

Preserves the window history. This allows the command <C-W>p to work as
expected.
